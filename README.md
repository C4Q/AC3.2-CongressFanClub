###**The Argument For Always Using Custom Error-Handling In Your Project Model**

It's often useful to find out where exactly you're hitting errors in your code; especially when using optionals, which can represent an absence of a value but not necessarily the location of your error. 

..*Common scenario: Parsing through an API with if/let and guard statements

```swift
enum ParsingErrors: Error {
    case partyError, personError, firstnameError, genderError, idError, lastnameError, nameError, stateError, roleTypeError, twitterIDError
}
```
